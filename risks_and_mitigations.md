# Risks and Mitigations

## Data Security and Privacy
- **Risk:** Sensitive medical data could be exposed if not properly secured.
  - **Mitigation:** Use strong encryption for storage and transfer. Implement robust authentication and access controls.

## Data Loss
- **Risk:** Files or metadata could be lost due to device failure or app bugs.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement regular backups and optional cloud sync.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Risk:** App may not function consistently across all target platforms.
  - **Mitigation:** Use a proven cross-platform framework and test on all supported devices.

## Usability
- **Risk:** Complex organization features may confuse users.
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize intuitive UI/UX design and provide onboarding/help resources.

- **Risk:** Large numbers of files or large file sizes could slow down the app.
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize file handling, lazy load content, and test with large datasets.

## Regulatory Compliance
- **Risk:** App may not comply with health data regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
