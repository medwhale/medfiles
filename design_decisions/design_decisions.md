# Design Decisions

## Initial Requirements
- The application must work on mobile and desktop (Android, macOS, ideally Windows and more).
- Users can import files of any type (PDFs, images, emails, etc.).
- Users can attach metadata to files: title, date, additional information, tags.
- Users can view files or copy them to the filesystem for manipulation.
- Files can be organized into collections (for one-off treatments) and collections of collections (for ongoing issues with multiple consultations).

## To Be Decided
- UI/UX framework(s) to use for cross-platform compatibility.
- File storage approach (local, cloud, hybrid).
- Security and privacy measures for sensitive medical data.
- Authentication and user management.
- Backup and sync options.
- Accessibility considerations.

## Architectural Discussion Points

1. **Platform & Technology Stack**
   - Which cross-platform framework will we use (React Native, Flutter, PWA, etc.)?
   - Will the app be fully local, or require a backend server for sync, sharing, or backup? If so, what backend technology?
   - What kind of database will store metadata and file references?

2. **Data Storage & File Management**
   - How will files and metadata be stored on the device?
   - If supporting sync, how will files be uploaded, stored, and retrieved securely?
   - How will we handle different file types for viewing and manipulation?

3. **Security & Privacy**
   - How will we encrypt files and metadata at rest and in transit?
   - What methods will be used for user authentication?
   - How will we ensure compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)?

4. **Testing & Deployment**
   - How will we test across devices and platforms?
   - How will users install the app?

5. **User Experience & Accessibility**
   - How will we ensure a consistent and intuitive UI across platforms?
   - What standards will we follow to ensure accessibility?
   - Will we support light and dark mode?
   - How will theming be implemented and maintained?

6. **Performance & Scalability**
   - How will the app perform with large numbers of files?
   - How will we manage memory, storage, and battery usage?

7. **App Structure & Modularity**
   - What are the main modules/components?
   - How easy will it be to add new features in the future?

## High-Level Architecture Proposal

### 1. Platform & Technology Stack
- **Cross-Platform Framework:** Use Flutter or React Native for a single codebase targeting Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and potentially Linux.
  - Flutter: Strong desktop and mobile support, excellent performance, growing ecosystem.
  - React Native: Mature for mobile, with community solutions for desktop.
- **Web Option:** Consider a Progressive Web App (PWA) for browser access, with some limitations on file system access and offline capabilities.

### 2. Data Storage & File Management
- **Local Storage:** Store files and metadata locally using secure storage (app sandbox, encrypted SQLite/Realm/Isar DB). Use file system APIs for import/export.
- **Cloud Sync (Optional):** Offer optional encrypted cloud backup/sync (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or custom backend) with end-to-end encryption.
- **File Types:** Support PDFs, images, text, and other common formats. Use platform viewers or in-app rendering for previews.

### 3. Security & Privacy
- **Encryption:** Encrypt all files and metadata at rest and in transit using strong, industry-standard libraries.
- **Authentication:**
  - Local: PIN, password, and/or biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, Android Biometrics).
  - Cloud: OAuth2 or similar for account-based sync.
- **Compliance:** Design with GDPR/HIPAA in mind: user data control, audit logs, and privacy by default.

### 4. App Structure & Modularity
- **Core Modules:** File Import/Export, Metadata Editor, Collections & Nested Collections, Search & Filter, Settings.
- **Extensibility:** Modular codebase to allow easy addition of features (e.g., OCR, sharing, notifications).

### 5. User Experience & Accessibility
- **Consistent UI:** Use a design system (Material Design, Cupertino, or custom) for a unified look and feel.
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG and platform-specific guidelines. Support screen readers, high-contrast modes, and large text.

### 6. Performance & Scalability
- **Efficient File Handling:** Lazy load file previews and metadata. Optimize for large numbers of files and large file sizes.
- **Resource Management:** Monitor and manage memory, storage, and battery usage, especially on mobile.

### 7. Testing & Deployment
- **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and UI tests across platforms.
- **Distribution:** Publish to Google Play, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store, and direct download for desktop. For web, deploy as a secure PWA.
