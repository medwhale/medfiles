# Testing & Deployment: High-Level Proposal

## 1. Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write unit tests for core logic, data handling, and security-critical code.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test interactions between modules (e.g., file import, encryption, metadata handling).
- **UI/End-to-End Tests:**
  - Use automated UI testing tools to simulate user flows across platforms.
- **Test Coverage:**
  - Aim for high coverage on critical paths (encryption, file handling, authentication).

## 2. Manual Testing
- **Exploratory Testing:**
  - Regularly perform manual testing to catch edge cases and usability issues.
- **Device/Platform Testing:**
  - Test on a range of devices and OS versions (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).
- **Accessibility Testing:**
  - Ensure the app is usable with screen readers, high-contrast modes, and large text.

## 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Automated Builds:**
  - Use CI/CD pipelines to build and test the app on every commit/PR.
- **Automated Tests:**
  - Run all automated tests as part of CI.
- **Vulnerability Checks:**
  - Integrate dependency vulnerability checks (see Security & Privacy).
- **Code Quality:**
  - Enforce linting, formatting, and code review policies.

## 4. Release Management & Distribution
- **Versioning:**
  - Use semantic versioning for releases.
- **Release Channels:**
  - Distribute via Google Play, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store, and direct download for desktop.
- **Beta Testing:**
  - Use beta channels (e.g., TestFlight, Google Play Beta) for pre-release testing.
- **Release Notes:**
  - Provide clear release notes for each version.

## 5. Monitoring & Feedback
- **Crash Reporting:**
  - Integrate privacy-respecting crash reporting (optional for MVP).
- **User Feedback:**
  - Provide a way for users to submit feedback or bug reports.

## Solo Developer Testing Strategy

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Focus on unit tests for core logic, security, and data handling.
  - Write integration tests for key workflows (e.g., file import, metadata edit, export).
  - Use lightweight UI/end-to-end tests for the most important user flows.
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Regularly perform exploratory and regression testing before releases.
  - Use checklists to ensure coverage of critical features and edge cases.
- **Device/Platform Coverage:**
  - Minimum coverage: Android, macOS, and Windows (test on at least one device per platform).
  - Use emulators/simulators for additional coverage if needed.
- **Beta Testing:**
  - No external beta testers for MVP; all testing will be self-test by the developer.
- **Crash/Bug Reports:**
  - For MVP, handle crash and bug reports via GitHub issues.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Set up basic CI to run automated tests and dependency checks on every commit/PR.
  - Use dependabot or similar for vulnerability monitoring and updates.

*Decision: Solo developer will focus on critical automated and manual testing, minimum device coverage (Android, macOS, Windows), self-test only, and GitHub issues for crash/bug reports in the MVP.* 

## Code Signing & Release Security

### Android
- **Code Signing:**
  - Required for all APKs/AABs distributed via Google Play or sideloaded.
  - Use a secure, password-protected keystore file to sign releases.
  - Keep the keystore and its password secure and backed up (do not commit to version control).
- **Release Security:**
  - Use Google Play App Signing for additional security and key management (recommended for Play Store releases).
  - For sideloaded apps, sign with your own keystore and distribute the APK/AAB directly.

### iOS/macOS
- **Code Signing:**
  - Required for all apps distributed via the App Store or TestFlight.
  - Use Apple Developer certificates and provisioning profiles.
  - Manage certificates and profiles via Xcode or Apple Developer portal.
  - For macOS, use Developer ID for notarization if distributing outside the App Store.
- **Release Security:**
  - Enable automatic certificate management in Xcode for simplicity.
  - Revoke and replace certificates if you suspect compromise.
  - For TestFlight/beta, use Appleâ€™s built-in distribution and signing.

### Windows
- **Code Signing:**
  - Strongly recommended for distributing EXE/MSI or Windows Store apps.
  - Use a code signing certificate (from a trusted CA or self-signed for internal/testing).
  - For Microsoft Store, follow their submission and signing process.
- **Release Security:**
  - Sign all binaries to prevent tampering and reduce security warnings for users.
  - Store certificates securely and never commit private keys to version control.

### General Best Practices
- Store signing keys/certificates in a secure, backed-up location (e.g., password manager, encrypted drive).
- Never share or commit private keys to public repositories.
- Use CI/CD secrets management to inject signing keys/certificates for automated builds (if CI/CD is used).
- Verify signatures before publishing and after download to ensure integrity.

### MVP Simplification
- For MVP, focus on signing with the minimum required for each platform (e.g., self-signed for local testing, official keys for store releases).
- Document the signing process and keep keys/certificates secure for future releases.

*Decision: Follow platform-specific code signing and release security best practices, with MVP simplification as needed.*
