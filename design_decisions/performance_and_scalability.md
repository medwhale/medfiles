*Update this file as performance and scalability decisions are made or requirements change.* 

## Expected File Counts

### Decision
- **Expected Maximum:** Hundreds of files in a single collection is the most likely maximum.
- **Thousands:** If there are thousands of files, they would likely be relatively small files.
- **Performance Target:** Design the app to handle hundreds of files efficiently in a single collection.

### Rationale
- Based on typical medical file organization patterns, users are unlikely to have thousands of files in a single treatment or collection.
- If users do have thousands of files, they are likely to be small documents, images, or notes rather than large files.
- This assumption allows for simpler, more efficient design without over-engineering for extreme cases.

---
*Decision: Design for hundreds of files per collection as the expected maximum, with thousands being unlikely or consisting of small files.* 

## File Compression

### Decision
- **MVP Approach:** Do not implement automatic file compression for the MVP.
- **Storage:** Store files in their original format to ensure no quality loss.
- **Future Consideration:** Add optional compression features in future versions based on user feedback and performance needs.

### Rationale
- Keeps the MVP simple and avoids potential quality loss issues.
- Users can manually compress files before importing if needed.
- Focus on efficient storage and loading rather than automatic compression.
- Medical files often require preservation of original quality for accuracy.

### Compression Options Considered
- **Automatic Compression:** Compress large images (>5MB) and PDFs with embedded images (>10MB).
- **Selective Compression:** Compress by file type and size threshold.
- **No Compression (Chosen):** Store files in original format, rely on efficient storage and lazy loading.

---
*Decision: No automatic file compression for MVP; store files in original format and consider optional compression features in future versions.* 

## Handling Very Large Files

### Performance Challenges
- **Memory Usage:** Large files can consume significant memory when loaded for viewing or processing.
- **Loading Time:** Large files take longer to load, encrypt/decrypt, and display.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Processing large files can block the UI thread and make the app unresponsive.

### Strategies for Large Files

#### Lazy Loading & Streaming
- **Progressive Loading:** Load and display large files progressively (e.g., show a low-resolution preview first, then load full resolution).
- **Chunked Processing:** Process large files in chunks (e.g., for encryption/decryption, thumbnail generation).

#### Preview & Thumbnail Strategy
- **Generate Previews:** Create and store low-resolution previews/thumbnails for large files.
- **Caching:** Cache previews and frequently accessed large files to improve performance.

#### Background Processing
- **Async Operations:** Process large files in background threads to keep the UI responsive.
- **Queue Management:** Implement a queue for processing multiple large files to avoid overwhelming the system.

#### User Experience
- **Clear Feedback:** Show file size and estimated loading time to users.
- **Graceful Degradation:** If a file is too large to process efficiently, show a message and offer alternatives (e.g., export to view externally).

### MVP Recommendation
- **Implement Lazy Loading:** Load large files progressively and show previews immediately.
- **Background Processing:** Process large files in background threads with progress indicators.
- **User Feedback:** Show file sizes and loading progress to users.
- **Fallback Options:** Allow users to export very large files to view externally if needed.

### Future Considerations
- Implement more sophisticated streaming and caching strategies.
- Add options for users to set size limits or preferences for large file handling.

---
*Decision: Use lazy loading, background processing, and user feedback for handling very large files in the MVP.* 

## Encryption Level

### Decision: File-Level Encryption
- **Implementation:** Each file is encrypted individually with its own encryption key.
- **Key Management:** File keys are encrypted with the master key (derived from PIN/recovery phrase).
- **Access Pattern:** Files are decrypted on-demand when accessed, not all at once.

### Performance Benefits
- **Fast App Startup:** No bulk decryption required on app launch.
- **Efficient Access:** Only decrypt files when needed (on read).
- **Scalable:** Performance doesn't degrade with large collections.
- **Memory Efficient:** Only loaded files consume decryption memory.

### Security Benefits
- **Granular Security:** Individual file compromise doesn't expose all data.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only accessed files are decrypted.
- **Flexible Access Control:** Potential for future per-file access controls.

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Container-Level Encryption:** All files in single encrypted container (slower startup, all-or-nothing access).
- **Hybrid Approach:** Metadata in decrypted database, large files encrypted individually (metadata exposure risk).

---
*Decision: Use file-level encryption with individual file keys for optimal performance and security.* 

## Caching Strategy

### Types of Data to Cache
- **File Previews/Thumbnails:** Images, PDF first pages, document icons.
- **Metadata:** File information, search indexes, UI state.
- **Search Results:** Pre-computed search data for fast filtering.

### Caching Strategies

#### Memory Cache (Fast Access)
- **Purpose:** Store frequently accessed data in memory for instant access.
- **Content:** Recently viewed previews, metadata, search results.
- **Size Limit:** Configurable (50-100MB for mobile, more for desktop).
- **Eviction Policy:** LRU (Least Recently Used) or time-based expiration.

#### Disk Cache (Persistent)
- **Purpose:** Store generated previews and metadata on disk to avoid regeneration.
- **Content:** Thumbnails, processed previews, search indexes.
- **Size Limit:** Larger than memory cache (500MB-1GB).
- **Cleanup:** Regular cleanup of old or unused cache entries.

#### Smart Caching
- **Predictive Loading:** Pre-load previews for files likely to be viewed.
- **Priority-Based:** Cache high-priority data (recent files, current collection) first.
- **Background Refresh:** Update cache in background when app is idle.

### Cache Management
- **Cache Keys:** Use file path/hash and modification time as cache key.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Invalidate when files are modified, deleted, or moved.
- **Cache Persistence:** Store cache in encrypted form, exclude from backups.

### Performance Considerations
- **Async Operations:** Generate and store cache entries in background threads.
- **Progressive Loading:** Show cached previews immediately, update with fresh data if needed.
- **Memory Management:** Monitor cache memory usage and evict when necessary.

### MVP Recommendation
- **Memory Cache:** Implement LRU cache for recently accessed previews and metadata.
- **Disk Cache:** Store generated thumbnails and previews on disk.
- **Smart Invalidation:** Invalidate cache when files change.
- **Configurable Limits:** Allow users to clear cache or adjust limits.

---
*Decision: Use multi-level caching (memory + disk) with smart invalidation and configurable limits for optimal performance.* 

## Balancing Performance with Security

### Performance-Security Trade-offs
- **Encryption/Decryption Overhead:** Each file must be decrypted when accessed, adding latency.
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2/Argon2 key derivation takes time (intentional for security).
- **Memory Usage:** Decrypted files consume more memory than encrypted ones.
- **Cache Security:** Cache must be encrypted to maintain security.

### Strategies for Balancing Performance and Security

#### Optimized Encryption
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Use platform-specific encryption acceleration (AES-NI, ARM Crypto Extensions).
- **Efficient Algorithms:** Use AES-GCM for authenticated encryption (fast and secure).
- **Key Caching:** Cache derived keys in secure memory (keychain, keystore) to avoid re-derivation.

#### Smart Caching Strategy
- **Encrypted Disk Cache:** Store encrypted previews and metadata on disk.
- **Memory Cache Limits:** Limit memory cache size to reduce exposure.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Clear sensitive cache data when app is backgrounded or locked.

#### Background Processing
- **Async Decryption:** Decrypt files in background threads to keep UI responsive.
- **Progressive Loading:** Show encrypted previews immediately, decrypt full content in background.
- **Queue Management:** Process encryption/decryption operations in priority queues.

#### User Experience Optimizations
- **Loading Indicators:** Show progress for encryption/decryption operations.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Allow users to cancel or pause heavy operations.
- **Performance Settings:** Allow users to adjust security-performance trade-offs (e.g., cache size, encryption strength).

### Security Considerations
- **Memory Protection:** Use secure memory for sensitive data when possible.
- **Key Management:** Store keys securely and rotate them periodically.
- **Audit Trail:** Log security-relevant events for debugging and compliance.

### MVP Recommendation
- **Use Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage platform-specific encryption acceleration.
- **Implement Smart Caching:** Use encrypted disk cache with limited memory cache.
- **Background Processing:** Process encryption/decryption in background threads.
- **User Feedback:** Show progress and allow cancellation of heavy operations.

### Future Considerations
- Implement more sophisticated key management and rotation.
- Add performance monitoring and analytics for security operations.
- Consider hardware security modules (HSM) for enterprise use cases.

---
*Decision: Use hardware acceleration, smart caching, and background processing to balance performance with security in the MVP.* 

## Performance Monitoring & Analytics

### MVP Decision: No Logging
- **No Performance Monitoring:** Do not implement any logging or analytics in the MVP.
- **Focus on Core Features:** Prioritize core functionality over monitoring and analytics.
- **Privacy-First Approach:** Avoid any data collection or tracking from the start.

### Future Considerations
- **Privacy-Respecting Logging:** If logging is added later, ensure it respects user privacy and data protection.
- **Opt-in Approach:** Any future logging should be opt-in with clear user consent.
- **Local Processing:** Process analytics data locally when possible to minimize data exposure.
- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate what data is collected and why.

### Design for Future Logging
- **Modular Architecture:** Design the app architecture to allow easy addition of logging later.
- **Privacy by Design:** Ensure any future logging features are designed with privacy in mind from the start.
- **User Control:** Allow users to control what data is collected and shared.
