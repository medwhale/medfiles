# User Experience & Accessibility: High-Level Proposal

## 1. Design System & UI Consistency

- **Cross-Platform Design:**
  - Use a consistent design system that works across all platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).
  - Adapt to platform-specific conventions while maintaining brand consistency.
  - Consider using Material Design 3 or a custom design system that can be adapted for all platforms.
- **Component Library:**
  - Create reusable UI components for common elements (buttons, cards, lists, forms).
  - Ensure components are accessible and follow design system guidelines.
- **Typography & Spacing:**
  - Use consistent typography scales and spacing systems.
  - Ensure text is readable across different screen sizes and resolutions.

## 2. Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG Compliance:**
  - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
  - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
  - Provide alternative text for images and icons.
- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - Implement proper semantic markup and ARIA labels.
  - Ensure screen readers can navigate the app effectively.
  - Provide descriptive labels for all interactive elements.
- **High Contrast & Large Text:**
  - Support high contrast modes for users with visual impairments.
  - Allow users to increase text size up to 200% without loss of functionality.
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

## 3. Theming & Personalization

- **Light/Dark Mode:**
  - For MVP only support light theme. In phase 2, add support for both light and dark themes.
  - In phase 2 allow users to choose their preferred theme or follow system settings. Provide three options: light, dark, system.
  - Ensure all content is readable in both themes.

## 4. User Flows & Navigation

- **Intuitive Navigation:**
  - Design clear and logical navigation patterns.
  - Use familiar UI patterns and gestures for each platform.
  - Provide breadcrumbs and clear navigation indicators.
- **User Onboarding:**
  - Create a simple and engaging onboarding experience.
  - Guide users through key features and functionality.
  - Provide contextual help and tooltips where needed.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Design user-friendly error messages and recovery options.
  - Provide clear feedback for user actions and system states.

## 5. Performance & Responsiveness

- **Fast Loading:**
  - Ensure the app loads quickly and responds to user interactions promptly.
  - Use loading indicators and skeleton screens for better perceived performance.

## 6. Mobile-First Design

- **Touch-Friendly Interface:**
  - Design for touch interactions with appropriate target sizes (44x44 points minimum).
  - Ensure buttons and interactive elements are easy to tap.
- **Responsive Layout:**
  - Design layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Use flexible grids and adaptive layouts.

## 7. Content & Information Architecture

- **Clear Information Hierarchy:**
  - Organize content in a logical and intuitive way.
  - Use clear headings, labels, and descriptions.
- **Search & Discovery:**
  - Implement effective search functionality with filters and sorting options.
  - Provide multiple ways to find and organize content.

## Open Questions

- How will we implement and test accessibility features across platforms?
- How will we handle different screen sizes and orientations (especially for tablets)?

## Design System Decision

### Decision: Material Design 3

- **Primary Design System:** Use Material Design 3 as the foundation for the app's UI/UX.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Provides consistent experience across Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
- **Light/Dark Theme Support:** Built-in comprehensive theming system with automatic system preference detection.
- **Medical Theme Customization:** Can be customized with medical-appropriate color palettes for both light and dark themes.

### Medical-Specific Theme Considerations

- **Light Theme:** Clean whites, professional blues, subtle grays suitable for medical environments.
- **Accent Colors:** Medical-appropriate blues and greens.
- **Contrast Ratios:** Maintain WCAG AA standards in both themes.

### Rationale

- **Cross-platform requirement:** Works well across all target platforms.
- **Built-in accessibility:** Strong accessibility support for medical users with diverse needs.
- **Solo developer efficiency:** Pre-built components reduce development time.
- **Medical appropriateness:** Clean, professional appearance suitable for healthcare applications.
- **Future scalability:** Easy to extend and customize as the app grows.

### Implementation Strategy

- Use Material Design 3 as the base design system.
- Implement subtle platform adaptations where beneficial (e.g., navigation patterns).
- Customize colors and typography for medical context.
- Leverage built-in accessibility features and theme system.

_Decision: Use Material Design 3 as the primary design system with medical-appropriate theming for light and dark modes._

## Platform-Specific UI Patterns and Conventions

### Material Design 3 Foundation with Platform Adaptations

#### Navigation Patterns

- **Android:** Use Material Design 3 navigation drawer and bottom navigation as primary patterns.
- **iOS/macOS:** Adapt to use tab bars and navigation stacks where beneficial, while maintaining Material Design aesthetics.
- **Windows:** Use Material Design navigation with Windows-specific adaptations for desktop interactions.

#### Gesture and Interaction Patterns

- **Touch Platforms (Android/iOS):**
  - Swipe gestures for file operations (delete, move).
  - Pull-to-refresh for file lists.
  - Long-press for context menus.
  - Material Design touch targets (48dp minimum).
- **Desktop Platforms (macOS/Windows):**
  - Right-click context menus.
  - Drag-and-drop for file operations.
  - Keyboard shortcuts for power users.
  - Hover states for interactive elements.

#### Platform-Specific Conventions

- **Android:** Material Design 3 components, back button behavior, system status bar integration.
- **iOS/macOS:** Subtle adaptations for native feel (navigation patterns, typography, touch targets).
- **Windows:** Desktop-specific interactions (window management, taskbar integration, keyboard navigation).

#### File System Integration

- **Android:** Use SAF (Storage Access Framework) for file access.
- **iOS/macOS:** Use native file picker and document browser.
- **Windows:** Use Windows file system APIs and native file dialogs.

#### Platform-Specific Features

- **Biometric Authentication:** Platform-specific implementations (Touch ID, Face ID, Android Biometrics).
- **Secure Storage:** Platform-specific keychain/keystore integration.
- **Background Processing:** Platform-specific background task handling.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Core Material Design Foundation:** Use Material Design 3 components as primary UI elements.
- **Platform Adaptations:** Make subtle platform-specific adaptations that enhance usability without breaking consistency.
- **Code Organization:** Shared components for core functionality, platform-specific wrappers where necessary.
- **Medical Context:** Maintain medical-appropriate appearance and accessibility across all platforms.

### Rationale

- Maintains visual and functional consistency for medical use case.
- Leverages platform strengths while preserving cross-platform benefits.
- Ensures accessibility standards are maintained across all platforms.
- Provides professional, trustworthy interfaces regardless of platform.
